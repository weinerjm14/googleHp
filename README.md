# googleHp
Project from The Odin Project Boot Camp in it's foundations portion of the course

For this project we were to emulate the Google home page. I took some liberties. I did not add the voice search or search magnifying glass to the search bar. I also used a hamberger menu instead of the 9 dot app menu as I have not taught myself to work with svgs at this time. Finaly I used the generic person icon and centered the main page contents.

I used HTML5, LESS CSS preprocessor, Flex box, and standard CSS 3 in this project. It was a great refresher on much I have forgotten since I last did anything in pure HTML and CSS.
